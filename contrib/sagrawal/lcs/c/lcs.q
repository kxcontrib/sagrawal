//Implementation of "An O(NP) Sequence Comparison Algorithm" 
//by Sun Wu, Udi Manber, Gene Myers and Web Miller.
//Note: P=(D-(M-N))/2, D is shortest edit distance, M>=N

//Returns indices in a and b for longest common sequence given equality function f
//Example: lcs["ABCABA";"CABBA"]
//In Miller-Myers diff algorithm, m>n - so, function flips arguments if this is not the case

//Wrapper to find mutations between two tables given s in sym column. c columns are used
//for mutation check - for example, price and size columns have very good quality signal

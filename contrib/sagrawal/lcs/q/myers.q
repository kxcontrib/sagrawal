//Implementation of Eugene Myer's "O(ND) Difference Algorithm and Its Variations"
//D is number of differences between two sequences - when the sequences are mostly
//similar, this algorithm is fast

//Note: Call lcs function to calculate longest common subsequence

//Function to calculate longest common subsequence backwards: as proven in Myer's O(ND)
// paper to find the LCS, it suffices to start on diagonal (n-m) and shortest edit 
//distance d, and traverse backwards (basically, inverse of path building, but with 
//only one particular path traversed back - that path has only one unique way of reaching 
//back to diagonal 0(remember diagonal k=x-y=0-0=0 at origin). All the diagonals in the
//path are matches and their indices in a and b provide us indices of respective longest 
//common subsequence. Horizontal and vertical paths are deltas

//Returns indices in a and b for longest common sequence given equality function f
//Example: lcs["ABCABA";"CABBA";=]
